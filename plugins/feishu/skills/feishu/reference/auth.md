# Authentication

## Required Credentials

Use a Feishu self-built app for the first version.

```bash
export FEISHU_APP_ID="cli_xxx"
export FEISHU_APP_SECRET="xxx"
```

## Recommended Auth Path

Prefer manual code exchange over upstream beta login flows and use the stable local MCP server for production use.

1. Generate or open the Feishu authorization URL in a browser.
2. After Feishu redirects to `http://localhost:3000/callback?...`, copy the `code` query parameter.
3. Exchange that code with `scripts/exchange-feishu-code.sh`.
4. Export the returned `user_access_token` as `FEISHU_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
5. Start Codex with the default `feishu-mcp` entry, which uses the local HTTP-backed server and reads `FEISHU_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

The exchange script uses Feishu's current OAuth token endpoint `authen/v2/oauth/token`, not the legacy `authen/v1/access_token`.

## MCP Server

The plugin declares one stable local MCP server:

```bash
command -v python3
```

- `feishu-mcp`: stable local server backed by direct Feishu OpenAPI HTTP calls.

If `python3` is unavailable, install Python 3 first.

## Manual Code Exchange

Export the app credentials first:

```bash
export FEISHU_APP_ID="cli_xxx"
export FEISHU_APP_SECRET="xxx"
```

Then exchange the callback code:

```bash
scripts/generate-feishu-auth-url.sh
```

Open the printed URL, authorize, then exchange the callback code:

```bash
scripts/exchange-feishu-code.sh --code "<callback_code>"
```

Optional flags:

```bash
scripts/generate-feishu-auth-url.sh \
  --scope "offline_access im:chat im:message"

scripts/exchange-feishu-code.sh \
  --code "<callback_code>" \
  --redirect-uri "http://localhost:3000/callback"
```

The script prints the raw Feishu response. On success, export the token:

```bash
export FEISHU_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN="<returned_user_access_token>"
```

If the response field is `access_token`, treat it as the returned `user_access_token` from Feishu OAuth and export it as `FEISHU_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

The stable local MCP server uses `FEISHU_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN` automatically.

## App ID vs Recipient ID

Do not confuse the app identity with the message recipient identity.

| Field | Example | Purpose | Safe to commit? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FEISHU_APP_ID` | `cli_xxx` | Identifies your Feishu self-built app. | No real value. Use placeholders only. |
| `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` | `xxx` | App credential used to obtain tenant tokens. | Never. |
| `FEISHU_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `u-xxx` | OAuth user token for user-owned resources. | Never. |
| `open_id` | `ou_xxxxx` | Identifies a Feishu user as a message recipient. | No real value. Use placeholders only. |
| `chat_id` | `oc_xxxxx` | Identifies a Feishu group or private chat. | No real value. Use placeholders only. |

For private assistant-style pushes, send to a user's `open_id`:

```yaml
tool: mcp__feishu-mcp__im_v1_message_create
params:
  receive_id_type: open_id
data:
  receive_id: "ou_xxxxx"
  msg_type: "text"
  content: "{\"text\":\"Codex project digest is ready.\"}"
useUAT: false
```

`FEISHU_APP_ID` answers "which app sends this message"; `open_id` answers "which user receives this message".

When a user asks to draft and send a Codex project update, verify the private push setup before sending:

1. `FEISHU_APP_ID` is configured.
2. `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` is configured.
3. A recipient `open_id` or target `chat_id` is known.
4. A short test message has been sent successfully.

If any item is missing, guide the user through setup first. Never infer an `open_id` from the app `App ID`, and never place real app IDs, secrets, tokens, `open_id`, `chat_id`, or message IDs in committed examples.

## Getting A User `open_id`

Recommended paths:

1. Ask the target user to send one private message to the bot, then inspect the Feishu event log for:

```text
event.sender.sender_id.open_id
```

2. If the app has contact permissions and the user is in the app's visibility scope, resolve by email:

```yaml
tool: mcp__feishu-mcp__contact_v3_user_batchGetId
params:
  user_id_type: open_id
data:
  emails:
    - "user@example.com"
```

Required permissions usually include:

- `contact:user.id:readonly`
- `im:message:send_as_bot`

If email lookup returns the email but no `open_id`, check app visibility scope, contact permissions, and whether the email belongs to the same Feishu tenant.

## Token Mode

- `useUAT: true`: user access token. Use this when resources should be owned by or visible to the current user.
- `useUAT: false`: tenant access token. Use this for app/bot-owned operations.

For created Docs or Bitable resources, default to `useUAT: true` unless the user explicitly wants bot-owned resources.

## Minimum Permissions

Start with narrow permissions and expand by workflow:

- Messages: `im:message:readonly`, `im:message:send_as_bot`
- Groups: `im:chat`, `im:chat.members:read`, optionally `im:chat:create`
- Docs: document read/edit permissions required by `docx` APIs
- Wiki: `wiki:wiki:readonly`, optionally `wiki:wiki`
- Drive permissions: permission member management
- Bitable: `bitable:app`
- For manual user token refresh support, add `offline_access`

Tenant admin approval may be required before production use.

## App Preconditions

Before blaming MCP runtime behavior, verify these Feishu app settings:

- The app is published and the current user can use it
- `http://localhost:3000/callback` is configured as a redirect URI
- If the app page shows a `refresh user_access_token` switch, it is enabled
- Required scopes are approved for the app and, when applicable, for user identity calls
